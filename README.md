## Design

### Color Scheme

The colors I chose were essential to the website. I chose something professional and sleek looking which is easy to read and does not distract.

The subtle gray is calming and makes any text on it stand out.


### Typography

I used Google Fonts for this website. 

Oxygen for titles and Quicksand for the main text sections.

### Imagery

The website uses a small amount of imagary which I feel drives home the message of the main hero image. It stands out as soon as you arrive at the homepage and it is clear in its message. The 'Our courses' section, uses vibrant and concise imagary which coverys what to expect from each course.

### Features 

The website is made up of 3 pages. A navigation menu which can bring the users to anywhere in the site. The first feature on the main page is the hero image which is overlaid with the words of the sites ethos 'Educate, Rewild, Reconnect which leads into the section below which elaborates on each of these sections.

Below this we find the 'Our Courses' section which displays a grid of courses which can be selected. This will bring you to a form where you can enter your details to find out more about the courses and enrol.

There is also a second form that allows users to request that we plant a tree in their name.

Below all this we have a foote where users can find a link to social media accounts.

#### Existing Features

Every page on the website has:

- __Navigation Bar__

  - Found at the top of the page is a fully responsive navigation bar where users can jump to the different sections of the site. When users hover over these selections, they are highlighted with a background color.

![Navigation bar](documentation/screens/navigation-bar.png)

- __Footer__ 

  - The footer has links to social media. I did not use icons as I thought the 'mirror' effect with the header was visually appealing. The links open in new windows to not distract users from the main site.

#### Home page

- __The home page image__

-  On the homepage,users are instantly met with a striking image of a child in the woods. It heavily features a selection of greens and is interesting to look at. It instantly converys the meaning of the site and welcomes the user, it has the keywords of the sites ethos overlaid on top of the image which further drives home the sites meaning.

![Landing page image](documentation/screens/landing-page.png)

- __Our goals section__

  - The our goals section features 3 sections each with one of the keywords of the ethos as a heading and elaborates on them in an easy to read and educational way.

![About us](documentation/screens/about-us.png)

- __Our Courses section__

  -  This is a 4x2 grid where users can browse what courses we have on offer. They each have their own image which conveys what to expect on the course and a text box whihc contains the course title. They also have a clickable link 'Enquire' that brings them to our course form.

### Features Left to Implement

- 
- Add submit page for forms rather than the Code Institute submit page taken from Love Running

### Accessibility

I have been attentive to make the website as accessible-friendly as possible through the following measures:

* Utilizing semantic HTML to provide meaningful structure and enhance accessibility.
* Incorporating descriptive alt attributes for images on the site to provide alternative text for screen readers.
* Ensuring an adequate color contrast across the site to improve readability for users with visual impairments. I employed the contrast checker provided by [WebAIM](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) to validate the contrast ratio between the selected foreground color and background color.
* Making menus accessible by indicating the current page as "current" for screen readers, aiding navigation and orientation.

By implementing these considerations, I have strived to enhance the overall accessibility of the website.

Codeanywhere was used to vreate this code. On 20th of July 2023, i ran out of workspace credits which was quickly solved by Rebecca from student support.

Github was used to store files for site

Google Fonts was where i  got the fonts used on the website.

I used Font Awesome For icons

I also used Google Dev Tools to help identify bugs and for debugging.

## Testing and Solved 


Tests for bugs was done consistently through making this site to catch and deal with them early

In my mid project meeting with Elaine Roche, the floowing problems were brought up and have been corrected:

responsiveness - maybe consider flexbox for courses at the bottom of the 

get nav  the links working

fix 404 on click on main title

get the hero image to load

footer on homepage - maybe add some blank space under it

distinguish the 2 different forms and add a phrase/blurb to drive home to the user the purpose of each

resize the form input area / fields so that they don't take up the full width of the screen

move down the submit buttons on the forms

add comments to html files

use header tag
